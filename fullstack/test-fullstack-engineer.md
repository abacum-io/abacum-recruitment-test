# Abacum Fullstack engineer test

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. 
We are very excited that you took the decision to apply for this position. 
To make sure you are a good fit we want to propose this coding test

## Coding test

The task is to create a simple webapp that allows the user to upload financial transactions 

### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met.

- Please complete the [Python Backend Engineer](backed-python/test-python-backend-engineer.md) in order to have a fully functioning Backend service. (Be aware that you'll likely have to iterate it to fulfill the rest of the requirements for this task. It's recommended to read the whole task description before proceeding with this point)
- Create a user interface to ease the use of our new Backend service
- Use React as the main framework and Material-ui as the basis for your ui
- Feel free to use whatever other frameworks/libraries/packages you like
- We would highly value the use of state management tools like Redux 
- You are encouraged to include tests

### User story 1

As a user, I can upload csv files to fill the transactions table and see the changes reflected on the interface

Acceptance criteria

I should be able to:
- [ ] see an empty transactions table when there are no transactions
- [ ] see a loading indicator while the new transactions are being processed by the Backend
- [ ] see the new transactions reflected on the table after successful response from the service

### User story 2

As a user, I should be able to use the filters provided by the Backend service as described [here](backed-python/test-python-backend-engineer.md)

### User story 3

As a user, when the table gets too big, I can use a pagination or infinite scrolling solution

### User story 4

As a user, I should be able to sort by account or amount
